-- This script works with any accessory you are currently wearing.
-- Want to wear multiple hats? Watch this tutorial:

-- If the console shows “clown” and no GUI appears, your executor might not be supported.

-- Your executor must support the "replicatesignal" function. If it doesn’t, the script will use a backup method called "loop respawn" that makes you keep respawning.
-- When your hat falls off or disappears, the script will try to bring it back by respawning your character.
-- Avoid lag, or it might not work properly.

-- If you’re playing a game called “just/ a baseplate.”, type “-pd” before running this script. That game uses for older method fe script (from 2021), so this script may behave differently there.
-- Command list for that game (Just a/ baseplate):
